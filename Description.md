Converting my examination project from my course in frontend development from Vanilla JS to React with Typescript.

The project description for the original project were as follows:

'The Movie Collector' is a web application that lets the user search for movies using a public movie API. The user should be able to:
- See atleast 10 movies without searching for anything.
- Search for movie titles and filter through movies by, for example, genres.
- When the user clicks on a chosen movie it should show more details about the movies (title, release date, genre, short description, movie poster, etc.).

Project requirements:

1. Data management with JSON
   - Fetch JSON formatted data from a public API.
   - Parse and present the JSON-data on the website.
2. HTTP/HTTPS
   - Use fetch() to make asynchronous GET-requests from the API.
   - Use async/await and try/catch for error handling of asynchronous operations.
   - Ensure that network errors, faulty search inputs and unexpected error gets handled in an accessible way.
3. Dynamic component & data types/operators
   - Let the user search for movies via a input element or through a filtered data list.
   - When the user interacts with either (ex. typing search paramaters or clicking a filter button) the page content should update dynamically.
   - Show search results and filtered data dynamically on the page (create elements in DOM).
   - Count and show the amount of search result matches. Use Javascript logic (ex. operators and conditions) to hide certain elements as needed.
   - When the user clicks on a chosen movie, show details (on the same page or through a modal/overlay).
4. UX/UI
   - Create a simple wireframe or mockup in Figma and show your thought process surrounding layout and UX/UI principles.
   - Attach a link or a picture of the Figma design in the repository.
   - Implement basic WCAG standards.
   - Use accessibility principles (consequences, feedback, error prevention etc.).
5. Revision control
   - Use Git for revision control.
   - Atleast 3 impactful commits.
   - One main branch.
   - One develop branch.
   - One feature branch.

Advanced requirements:

1. Favourites list
   - Let user save their favourite movies in a list and save them with LocalStorage and show them on the page.
2. Responsive design
   - Make the user interface responsive to 3 different sized screens (phone, tablet and desktop).
3. UX/UI
   - Make Figma designs for all 3 screens.
4. Advanced asynchronous management
   - Use Promise.all() or caching.
5. Advanced revision control
   - One main branch, one develop branch, atleast 3 feature branches with correct merging order.
   - Atleast 5 commits with good documentation of changes
6. Create a second page for the web application
7. Organization
   - Show good praxis for file structure
